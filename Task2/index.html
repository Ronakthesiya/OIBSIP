            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January
                7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.), Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented
                the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the
                three-phase system of electric power transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold
                the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George
                Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.</p>
